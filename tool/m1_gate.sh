# tool/m1_gate.sh — M1 Foundation & Scaffold structural verification gate
#
# Asserts the full M1 target tree in one runnable command.  Run from the repo
# root: bash tool/m1_gate.sh
#
# Exit 0 only when ALL checks (a)–(l) pass.
# Exit 1 on the FIRST failing check with a descriptive message that names
# exactly what is missing or wrong.
#
# Design rules:
#   - Every check is load-bearing: temporarily removing any asserted artifact
#     MUST flip that specific check to fail.
#   - plutil / assetutil are macOS-only and are NOT used here; those validations
#     remain in ios.yml CI steps.  CFBundleIconName is asserted via grep.
#   - No network access; no Gradle tasks; no xcodebuild calls.  This script is
#     a pure structural audit runnable on any bash host (Linux or macOS).
