/**
 * Domain port (repository interface) for the recovery persistence boundary.
 *
 * Port of the Dart `RecoveryRepository` abstract interface class.
 *
 * ## API surface (§5.1.1)
 *
 * Six non-suspend members (okio I/O is blocking — the Dart async split collapses
 * to one synchronous save):
 *   - [save]      — writes the buffer text; returns the written file path as a String.
 *   - [list]      — newest-first notes; empty list when the dir is absent.
 *   - [read]      — returns file text or null if the file has vanished.
 *   - [delete]    — no-op if the file or directory is absent.
 *   - [deleteAll] — no-op if the directory is absent.
 *   - [trim]      — keep newest `keep` files by lexicographic filename (NEVER mtime).
 *
 * ## Dropped from the Dart oracle
 *
 *   - `saveSync` — dropped by construction (okio is synchronous; no async split needed).
 *   - `keep` default on `trim` — the literal `10` lives at the use-case boundary
 *     ([SaveBufferToRecovery]), NOT on this interface.
 *
 * ## Error contract
 *
 * okio `IOException` from [save] MUST propagate unchanged (no swallow, no wrap).
 * [list], [read], [delete], [deleteAll], [trim] tolerate an absent directory and
 * vanished/changed files without throwing (FR-16, FR-18, R-A4).
 *
 * ## Domain purity
 *
 * This file imports only types within the `recovery` package. It must never import
 * okio, Flutter, or any infrastructure package.
 *
 * Spec refs: §5.1.1, FR-11..FR-18; assessment R-A3, R-A4, R-A5 (drop-list).
