// Foglietto — KMP Milestone 4: Liquid Glass Chrome
//
// View model backing the menu bubble. Ctor-injected (DIP, no provider
// indirection). With the theme picker and font-size rocker removed (user
// direction — the app always follows the system theme and the system default
// font), it owns exactly one responsibility: fresh RecoveryListViewModel
// creation on each submenu expand.
//
// Spec refs: FR-12; NFR-05, NFR-06; EC-10.
// Contract: §5.1.d.

///   - `viewModel: BufferViewModel` — for passing to fresh `RecoveryListViewModel` instances.
