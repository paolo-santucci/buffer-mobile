// Chrome/RecoveryListViewModel.swift
// Foglietto — KMP Milestone 4: Liquid Glass Chrome
//
// @Observable view model backing the "Recent notes" inline recovery submenu.
// Re-fetches RecoveryRepository.list() on every expand (not launch-cached).
// Maps each RecoveryNote to a RecoveryRow for display.
// Restore-on-tap only — no delete, delete-all, or confirm dialog (FR-14).
//
// RecoveryInstant → subtitle is formatted in Swift from the 7 Int fields.
// NO Date is used; NO epoch arithmetic is used (NFR-06).
// RecoveryRepository is called DIRECTLY (no read-side use case; no okio import).
//
// Spec refs: FR-12, FR-13, FR-14, FR-23, NFR-06;
//            EC-02, EC-04, EC-05, EC-06, EC-16.
// Contract: §5.1.d, §5.1.c (RecoveryRepository direct call, OQ-07 decision).

// MARK: - RecoveryListViewModel

/// `@Observable` view model backing the "Recent notes" inline recovery submenu.
///
/// **Ctor-injected (DIP):**
///   - `recovery: RecoveryRepository` — for `list()` and `read(path:)` calls.
///   - `viewModel: BufferViewModel` — for `populate(_:)` on restore.
///
/// **Re-fetch on every expand (FR-12):**
/// `refresh()` calls `recovery.list()` on every invocation. There is no launch-time
/// cache — the submenu reflects on-disk state at the moment of expansion. This satisfies
/// EC-05 (mutated file) and EC-06 (absent dir on first expand, which causes `list()`
/// to return `[]` without crashing).
///
/// **Restore-on-tap, nil-tolerant (FR-13 / EC-04):**
/// `select(path:)` calls `recovery.read(path:)`. If the result is `nil` (file
/// vanished since `list()` — EC-04), nothing is restored and no crash occurs.
/// If non-nil, `viewModel.populate(_:)` is called exactly once (FR-13).
///
/// **List only — no delete (FR-14):**
/// No `delete`, `deleteAll`, or confirmation affordance is present on this class.
///
/// **No okio across the boundary:**
/// `RecoveryRepository` is called directly; `okio.FileSystem`/`okio.Path` are
/// internal to the shared Kotlin module and are never referenced in Swift (OQ-07 decision).
